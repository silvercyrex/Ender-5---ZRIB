# Ender-5 BLTouch Marlin 2.0.5.4
My version of Ender 5 firmware from vanilla Marlin with BLTouch as well as Many features i can possibly enable

As the Repo name says, this is running on a ZRIB V6 Controller board
the ZRIB header file is from the official Zonestar "patch" which needed to be patched itself in a couple of places since the way marlin names some things has changed
as well as the fix for the graphics glitch on the RepRapDiscount Full Graphic Smart Controller clones

most of the motion configuration is identical to the example one from Marlins repo with all the bells and whistles enabled to make this Ender 5 do anything i can
