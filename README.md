# Ender-5 BLTouch Marlin 2.0.5.4
My version of Ender 5 firmware from vanilla Marlin with BLTouch as well as linear Advance 
those two take out of ProgMem so a few things had to go like AutoTemp and a few more things i cant remember

most of the configuration is identical to the example one from Marlins repo
