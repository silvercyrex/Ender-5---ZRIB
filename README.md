# Ender-5 BLTouch Marlin 2.0.5.4
My version of Ender 5 firmware from vanilla Marlin with BLTouch as well as Many features i can possibly enable

As the Repo name says, this is running on a ZRIB V6 

most of the motion configuration is identical to the example one from Marlins repo with all the bells and whistles enabled to make this Ender 5 do anything i can
